# TODO List App

This repository contains the To Do List application, a powerful and efficient task management app developed for Android. The app allows users to create, manage, and track tasks individually, helping them stay organized and productive.

## Features

# Technologies Used

The app is built using modern Android development practices and leverages the following technologies

- 🏗 MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): A robust architectural pattern that separates the user interface logic from business logic, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.
- 🚨 Dagger-Hilt: Dependency injection library for managing and providing dependencies across the application, leading to better scalability and testability.
- 🗃 Room and SQLite: Database libraries for storing and managing local data with ease, offering a seamless integration with the app's architecture.
- 🕓 Coroutines: Kotlin's concurrency design pattern, allowing for smooth and efficient background operations without blocking the main thread.
- 🚀 LiveData: A lifecycle-aware component that provides updates to the UI when data changes, ensuring that the app's UI remains responsive.
- 🎨 DataBinding and ViewBinding: Tools that bind UI components to data sources in a clean and efficient manner, reducing boilerplate code.
- 📲 Navigation Component: A framework for handling all navigational needs within the app, including fragment transitions and deep linking.
- 🎴 RecyclerView: A flexible and efficient component for displaying lists of data, allowing users to view and interact with their tasks seamlessly.
